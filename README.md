Jeroo starts at (0,0) facing EAST.  It should plant a flower on one shore and then go to the other shore to plant a flower then come back to the first shore.  It should repeat this until both shores are full of flowers.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT just plant all flowers on one shore and then do the other shore.  The Jeroo should alternate between shores.
